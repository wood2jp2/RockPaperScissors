# RockPaperScissors
Simple rock, paper, scissors game using some HTML and JavaScript.

The user keys an "r", "s", or "p", based on their choice of rock, scissors, or paper. The computer makes a choice based on a random number function. Wins, losses, and ties are recorded directly on the web page, and each round's choices are logged directly to the console as well.
